# Falling-Objects-Game
This a Digital Logic Desing in which we Fall objects game.In this game, there is a grid of 72 LEDâ€™s (9 rows by 8 columns) in which the user must move a light representing a platform (bucket) from left to right to catch falling objects. The controls are two momentary pushbuttons. If the user successfully keeps the platform under a falling object while it is in the bottom row, the score will increment, shown on the two-digit In seven segment display. Otherwise, the death count will increment, displayed on a third seven segment display. There are four different stages in the game, in which the objects fall at a different speed, thus increasing the complexity and challenge of the game. The game ends when the user reaches 10 deaths. When this occurs, the game clock is disabled so the objects freeze in place on the screen to indicate that the game is over
